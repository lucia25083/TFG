This project focuses on estimating the pressure map exerted by the human body on a mattress
using infrared images. Prolonged immobility of patients in hospital settings can result in pressure
ulcers, which occur when certain areas of the body experience constant pressure against a surface
such as a mattress. The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning method, using architectures
like U-Net, to estimate these pressure maps accurately. The work explores two approaches: an end-to-
end model and a skeleton-based model that integrates pose information to better approximate how the
body interacts with the mattress. Additionally, a simple risk detection system has been implemented to
analyze the predicted pressure maps and identify body areas that are most at risk of developing ulcers.
This provides a non-invasive, affordable solution for patient monitoring in both clinical and home care
settings, helping caregivers take timely action to prevent pressure injuries
